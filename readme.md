# Web Crawler written in Python 3.11

## What is this repo
This is one of my first things I've built in Python, so a lot of what I am doing in here is learning the core language features and how concepts I know from other languages apply.

So bear with me on code quality or approach, please let me know if there are suggestions you'd make on approach, coding style, performance, etc.

## Install the following packages

```sudo pip3 install requests```
